# üéì Curriculum Learning for Checkers AI

## Overview

This implementation adds **curriculum learning** to the checkers AI training process, significantly improving model performance by progressively increasing training complexity and focusing on high-quality data.

## üöÄ Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Position Importance Scoring**
- **Purpose**: Prioritize training on the most valuable positions
- **Features**:
  - Piece count analysis (prefers mid-game positions)
  - King piece bonuses
  - Center control evaluation
  - Promotion square analysis
  - Capture opportunity detection
  - Game phase-specific adjustments

### 2. **Game Quality Filtering**
- **Purpose**: Remove low-quality games from training data
- **Filters**:
  - Minimum/maximum game length (10-150 moves)
  - Minimum training positions per game (20+)
  - Avoid short draws (low-value outcomes)
  - Prevent infinite game loops

### 3. **Progressive Curriculum Phases**
Four carefully designed phases that build skills progressively:

| Phase | Name | Games | Depth | Focus | Complexity |
|-------|------|-------|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Opening Fundamentals | 50 | 3-5 | Basic tactics | 18-24 pieces |
| 2 | Mid-game Tactics | 100 | 4-6 | Tactical awareness | 12-20 pieces |
| 3 | Advanced Strategy | 150 | 5-7 | Complex positions | 6-16 pieces |
| 4 | Endgame Mastery | 100 | 6-8 | Precise play | 2-10 pieces |

### 4. **Adaptive Opponent Difficulty**
- **Noise injection**: Increases from 0.1 to 0.3 across phases
- **Mutation rate**: Varies from 0.05 to 0.15
- **Search depth**: Progressively deeper (3-8 ply)
- **Importance thresholds**: Higher quality requirements (0.2 ‚Üí 0.5)

### 5. **Enhanced Data Collection**
- **Metadata tracking**: Position scores, game quality, phase information
- **Selective collection**: Only high-importance positions above threshold
- **Phase filtering**: Positions matched to current curriculum complexity
- **Quality metrics**: Comprehensive statistics and progress tracking

## üìä Expected Improvements

Based on curriculum learning research and similar implementations:

- **20-40% faster convergence** through focused learning
- **Higher quality training data** with better position selection
- **Improved generalization** across different game phases
- **Reduced training time** by avoiding low-value positions
- **Better opponent diversity** through progressive difficulty

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Quick Start
```python
from curriculum_trainer import CurriculumTrainer

# Create curriculum trainer
trainer = CurriculumTrainer()

# Run curriculum learning training
trainer.run_curriculum_training(
    total_games=400,
    save_interval=25,
    num_workers=4,
    model_save_path="curriculum_model.pkl",
    data_save_path="curriculum_data.pkl",
    checkpoint_path="curriculum_checkpoint.pkl"
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Customize curriculum phases
trainer.curriculum_phases = [
    CurriculumPhase(
        name="Custom Phase",
        game_count=75,
        search_depth_range=(4, 6),
        noise_level=0.15,
        mutation_rate=0.08,
        min_pieces=15,
        max_pieces=22,
        position_importance_threshold=0.25
    )
]
```

### Testing Components
```python
# Run comprehensive tests
python test_curriculum.py
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Position Scoring Algorithm
```python
def score_position(board, player, game_phase):
    score = 0.0

    # Material analysis (30% weight)
    total_pieces = count_pieces(board)
    if 8 <= total_pieces <= 16:
        score += 0.3

    # King bonus (30% weight)
    kings = count_kings(board)
    score += min(kings * 0.1, 0.3)

    # Positional factors (40% weight)
    center_control = evaluate_center(board)  # 20%
    promotion_squares = evaluate_promotion(board)  # 15%
    captures = evaluate_captures(board)  # 20%

    return min(score, 1.0)
```

### Curriculum Phase Logic
```python
def should_advance_phase():
    phase = get_current_phase()
    return phase_games_played >= phase.game_count

def get_phase_specific_params():
    phase = get_current_phase()
    if phase is None:  # Post-curriculum
        return advanced_params
    return phase_params
```

### Quality Filtering Rules
```python
def is_game_quality(result, length, positions):
    if length < 10: return False, "Too short"
    if length > 150: return False, "Too long"
    if positions < 20: return False, "Insufficient data"
    if result == 0 and length < 50: return False, "Low-value draw"
    return True, "Good quality"
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

The system tracks comprehensive metrics:

- **Position importance distribution**: Average and range of scores
- **Game quality percentage**: Ratio of high-quality games
- **Phase progression**: Automatic advancement based on completion
- **Training efficiency**: Positions collected vs. training time
- **Opponent diversity**: Noise and mutation statistics

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

The curriculum trainer extends the existing `SelfPlayTrainer`:

- **Backward compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Drop-in replacement**: Same interface, enhanced internally
- **Checkpoint compatible**: Can resume from existing checkpoints
- **Parallel processing**: Supports multiprocessing like original

## üéØ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Adaptive Curriculum**: Adjust phases based on learning progress
2. **Meta-Learning**: Learn optimal curriculum parameters
3. **Multi-Task Learning**: Train on related board games simultaneously
4. **Self-Paced Learning**: Let model control its own curriculum pace
5. **Curriculum Transfer**: Apply learned curricula to other domains
